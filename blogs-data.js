    content: `In this vast infinite Universe, there are a lot of mysteries that are still to be raveled.  We, the humans are part of the Milky Way Galaxy which is just a small dot in this huge boundless universe.  There are many more galaxies which are very big and vast as compared to our galaxy.  Andromeda is one of them. 

      
    Located approximately 3 Million light years far off from our Galaxy, this was one Galaxy which sparked an interest in humans to explore this and more such Galaxies present in the Universe.  Earlier it was considered to be a part of Milky Way galaxy (as scientist were of the opinion that only Milky Way galaxy exist in the Universe) and was thought to be a Nebula. 
    
    
    Andromeda was first grouped in Charles Messier's list of interstellar objects and was called Messier 31 or just M31.  For many years, many scientists gave their own theories and explanations on its existence however  not much could be scientifically proved.  Edwin Hubble, an American scientist claimed and further proved that Andromeda was not a Nebula but a Galaxy which was way bigger than our Milky way galaxy.  

    
    It is said that Andromeda was formed approximately 10 billion years ago due to the collision and subsequent merger of small protogalaxies.  Its name 'Andromeda'  is derived from the area of the earth's sky in which it appears, which is named after the Ethiopian Princess and also the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology. Our Milky Way Galaxy and Andromeda galaxy are expected to collide in approx. 4.5 billion years  to form a giant elliptical galaxy.  how true is this --only time will tell.`,

    content: `For almost  hundred years now, space scientists have debated over the existence of a mysterious Planet 9 or Planet X ambushed somewhere in the outer range of solar system. Researchers believe that Planet X, also referred to as Planet 9, is much bigger than Earth (almost ten times than earth), and made up of gases completely. Why Planet 9 coz Pluto is no more considered as a fullbodied planet owing to its very small size - its now categorised as 'dwarf' planet.
    
    
    The term Planet 9 and theories around it started surfacing after the discovery of Planet Neptune in the year 1846 by Johann Gottfried Galle.  Scientists opined that there could be a planet that might be existing behind Neptune's orbit.   Around the same time, an American mathematician, Percival Lowell had his theory around planet 9's existence based on his mathematical calculations. Lowell's sudden death in 1916  halted the search for Planet X for some time. These theories started resurfacing again in 1930 when Clyde Tombaugh, an American astronomer discovered Pluto - the 9th planet of our solar system until very recently(it was confirmed to be a dwarf planet in 2008). 
    
    
    Unfortunately, Pluto did not qualify as 'that' 9th planet as it did not met the conditions as predicted by Lowell. After 1978, a number of astronomers kept up the search for Lowell's Planet X, convinced that, as Pluto was no longer a viable candidate, an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing the outer planets. 
    
    
    Although most astronomers accept that Lowell's Planet X does not exist, a number have revived the idea that a large unseen planet could be there in the outer Solar System. Finding this Planet 9 or Planet X might still be a big astronomical challenge but scientists are quite hopeful to do so in next ten years.`,

    After a long long hiatus, its so rejuvenating and exciting to be back to one of the few things I love to do üòä.
    
    When I saw these breathtaking pictures and videos clicked through drone of the Icelandic Volcano eruption, I was totally blown away by its beauty and even though not related to Universe, I thought to write about it since time infinite, volcanoes have been considered the foundation that has allowed human lives to thrive and civilizations to flourish. 
    
    In a way, they too are one of the reasons why we exist on this planet.
    Followed by several weeks of earthquakes, in the nearby areas, this volcano erupted in Iceland near the capital Reykjavik on 19th March. 
    
    A red cloud lit up the night sky after the eruption began in Fagradalsfjall about 40km south-west from the capital Reykjavik. 
    
    Stunning footage of the eruption started coming soon after and as I write this blog today, I read that tourists and onlookers throng the area to have one sight of this bewitching visual. 
    
    Scientists were seen enjoying sausages barbecued on hot molten lava üòä.However, the site was again closed after some time as there is leakage of poisonous gases and substances anticipated. Even though the area is uninhabited and the eruption is not expected to present any danger.
    
    The Krysuvik volcanic system has been inactive for the past 800 years. The source of the eruption is a large body of molten rock, magma, which has pushed its way to the surface over the past weeks and has caused the earthquakes. The number of quakes had slowed down in recent days, leading geologists to say that an eruption would be less likely. 
    
    Aside from crowds of onlookers and a possible archaeological site, not much has been threatened by the lava so far. The Icelandic Meteorological Office is monitoring the volcano and sharing the results of the study.
    

    I wish I could witness these visuals in person!

    content: `Today, am gonna write on this topic which is somewhat different from what I usually write about but since it is so relevant in present times, could not refrain myself writing my thoughts around this.Major part of the world is on quarantine due to the severe outbreak of this global pandemic Covid-19.  Cities have turned ghost towns. People are dying because of this catastrophe and our lives looks so frail, so easy to fall prey to this deadly disease.  We are living in an uncertain world ‚Äì don‚Äôt know how will the next day be like. 
      
      
      Nevertheless, In between all this mayhem, the basic purpose of our existence and spirit should live on.  We have to keep living each day as it comes.  This pandemic has severely hit our economy and also our education process and system.  Educational institutions have been shut for a long time and there was a dire need for institutions to come up with an alternative plan as to how can we continue the learning momentum for our kids and youth.  This catastrophe has shown us the brighter side of virtual mode of learning.  Online learning is emerging as the best possible option to continue our learning journey at this point of time across the educational institutions of the world. I am (and I am sure everyone in this world too) amazed how we have adapted to this ‚ÄúNew Normal‚Äù.  
      
      
      Educational institutions have come up with alternative method of teaching and assessing.  Hybrid model is gaining popularity and has its own merits.  I no longer have to worry to dress up, spend at least half an hour to commute to attend a coaching class any more.  And I am liking it this way üòä.  Frankly, this is such a leap towards advancement of our learning journey.  School, colleges, University are doing all they can to maintain their quality of education amidst this crisis through virtual mode of imparting education. Indeed, academic institutions would not be able to transform all of their curricula into an online resource overnight. Distance, scale, and personalized teaching and learning are the three biggest challenges for online teaching. Teaching assisting tools by Google and Microsoft can be really useful under such problematic situations; Google forms for assessment purpose, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams for virtual classes, Google Drive for storing information etc. are very powerful and wonderful tools and the world is using them to the best extent possible.
      
      
      Obviously all this comes with equal number of concerns around this‚Äì there has been much uproar about students having too much gadget-time due to their long hours of virtual schooling.  In India, higher classes students have to attend multiple coaching classes as well. This is resulting in numerous cases where students complains about sore, itching eyes and vision concerns.  The other great concern was lack of advance wi-fi infrastructure.  We were never prepared for this kind of scenario and suddenly the entire learning and economy activities were dependent on internet.  Before this pandemic, I can‚Äôt remember we had any wi-fi issues but during pandemic, almost every day we had connectivity issues due to staggered connection.  In a third world country like India, internet is still a luxury for almost half the population.  In fact undeveloped and rural areas have comparatively lower level of infrastructure available due to low population density and lack of viable business opportunities.  How will learning continue for students residing in such areas?  
      
      
      Now almost 2 years after COVID struck the world,  things are in much better shape but still this is something not within the reach of each and every person on this planet. Having said this, educational institution do much more than just deliver content and teach. The teachers‚Äô ability to engage students in debate and discussion, to mentor and coach and to inspire and motivate is difficult to achieve in the online format. What is also difficult to replicate is peer learning, participation in extracurricular activities and sports, experiential learning and development of emotional quotient. While schools and colleges the way we know them traditionally are here to stay, the way learning and teaching happens is sure going to change.`,

    content: `Hello everyone. So today's subject of thought is the much awaited, one of its kind telescope, the James Webb telescope (named after renowned Astronomer and NASA administrator (1961-68) James E Webb) which is going to be launched by NASA in association with Canadian and European space agencies on Christmas eve this year. 
      
      
      Ever since it was made in 2016, its launch has been continuously delayed owing to its humongous size and damages occurred to it .  It is considered to be the most advanced telescope replacing its predecessor, Hubble.  If we speak about its specifications, it has mass of about half of Hubble but its primary mirror, having a gold-coated beryllium reflector will have a collecting area almost six times as large as Hubble with the use of 18 hexagonal mirrors.  It is designed primary for near-infrared astronomy but can also see orange and red visible light as well as the mid-infrared region.  
      
      
      Because of its spectacular specifications, scientists have claimed that they will be able to date back in time and can gather more about the formation of our own Milky Way Galaxy by observing other galaxies in their early stages which is indeed the most exciting thing about it. This will be a supremely awaited special day for all who worked tirelessly all these years to make this happen.  Not to mention, the many more avenues it will open towards study, observations and research purposes. 

      
    Waiting with bated breath.  Fingers crossedü§ûü§û`,

    content: `Hello fellow cricket lovers. Today, I write with a heavy heart, sharing the sorrow and disappointment of India‚Äôs loss to Australia in the 2023 Cricket World Cup final.
  
  The journey to the final was filled with hope and excitement. Under the leadership of Rohit Sharma, the Indian team showcased remarkable skill and determination throughout the tournament. Every match was a testament to their hard work and dedication, making us believe that this was our year.

  The semi-final against New Zealand was a nail-biter. Virat Kohli's brilliant century and Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional bowling in the death overs led us to a thrilling victory, setting the stage for an epic final against Australia. The anticipation was palpable, and fans across the nation were united in their support for the team.

  The final, however, was a different story. Batting first, India struggled to build momentum after the fall of Rohit Sharma's wicket and posted a modest total of 241. Despite a valiant effort from the bowlers, Australia's batting lineup helmed by Travis Head proved too strong, and they chased down the target with ease. The sight of the Australian team lifting the trophy was a bitter pill to swallow.

  This loss is not just about the defeat; it's about the dreams that were shattered and the hopes that were dashed. It's a reminder of the unpredictability of cricket and the fine margins that separate victory from defeat. As fans, we feel the pain and disappointment, but we also stand by our team, proud of their efforts and the journey they undertook.

  As a cricket fan, this loss is incredibly hard to accept. It brings back memories of past heartbreaks but also strengthens our resolve to support the team through thick and thin. The emotions, the tears, and the sense of loss are indescribable. The sight of the Indian team walking off the field, heads held high despite the defeat, is a moment that will stay with us forever.

  Here's to the Indian cricket team for their valiant effort, for giving us moments of joy and hope, and for reminding us of the beauty and heartbreak of the game. Let's stand together, support our team, and look forward to future victories. Jai Hind! üáÆüá≥üèè`,

    content: `Hello fellow cricket enthusiasts! Today, I want to share my excitement about one of the most storied and thrilling contests in the world of cricket‚Äîthe Ashes Test series.

    The Ashes series, a five-match Test cricket competition between England and Australia, is a rivalry that dates back to 1882. It all began when Australia defeated England at The Oval, leading a British newspaper to publish a satirical obituary lamenting the death of English cricket and stating that "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia." Thus, the legend of the Ashes was born, symbolized by a small urn that is believed to contain the ashes of a cricket bail.

    Over the years, the Ashes has seen some of the most remarkable and dramatic moments in cricket history. One of the earliest legendary contests was in 1932-33, known as the "Bodyline" series, where England employed controversial bowling tactics to counter the formidable Australian batsman, Sir Don Bradman. The strategy worked, but it sparked heated debates and strained relations between the two nations.

    Fast forward to 1981, and we have the unforgettable "Botham's Ashes." After being forced to follow on, England, led by Ian Botham's heroic all-round performances and Bob Willis's devastating bowling, staged an incredible comeback to win the third Test at Headingley. This victory turned the series around, and England went on to win the Ashes that year.

    In more recent times, the 2005 Ashes series is often hailed as one of the greatest of all time. England, under the captaincy of Michael Vaughan and with standout performances from players like Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen, won the series 2-1, regaining the Ashes after 18 years. The series was marked by intense matches, narrow margins, and moments of individual brilliance.

    The 2019 Ashes also provided cricket fans with unforgettable moments. Who could forget Ben Stokes's extraordinary innings at Headingley, where he single-handedly led England to a miraculous victory, keeping their hopes alive in the series?

    Each Ashes series is not just about the cricket; it's about the rich history, the fierce rivalry, and the incredible passion of the fans. The battles on the field, the sportsmanship, and the moments of brilliance make the Ashes a unique and cherished part of cricketing folklore.

    As we gear up for the next installment of this historic contest which is to be held next year, I can hardly contain my excitement. Will Australia retain the urn, or will England reclaim it? Whatever happens, we can be sure that the Ashes will continue to deliver the drama, excitement, and unforgettable moments that have made it a cornerstone of the sport. üèèüî•

    Here's to another thrilling chapter in the Ashes saga. Let the games begin!`,

    content: `Hello cricket fans! Today, I am overjoyed to share the exhilarating news of India's remarkable victory in the T20 World Cup after a long wait of 17 years as today we ended the drought of almost a decade for an ICC trophy and clinched the T20 World Cup unbeaten. As a die-hard fan, this triumph is nothing short of a dream come true.

        It was in 2007 when India first tasted T20 World Cup glory under the inspirational leadership of MS Dhoni. That victory was a watershed moment for Indian cricket, propelling the team into the global spotlight and igniting a passion for the shortest format of the game among millions of fans. Fast forward to 2024, and India has done it again, capturing the coveted trophy and etching their names in cricketing history once more.

        The journey to this victory was nothing short of spectacular. Under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma, the team displayed exceptional skill, resilience, and teamwork despite coming off a huge upset in their last ICC outing against Australia. The group stages saw some nail-biting encounters especially with the arch rivals Pakistan where Jasprit Bumrah saved the day, but India's consistent performances ensured they topped their group and advanced to the knockout stages with confidence.

        The semi-final clash against a formidable England side was a testament to India's grit and determination. Stellar performances from the likes of Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav, who played a match-winning knock, and Jasprit Bumrah, whose deadly yorkers dismantled the English batting lineup yet again, secured India a place in the final.

        The final against South Africa at Barbados was a showdown that had fans on the edge of their seats. Batting first despite losing quick wickets of Hitman and Pant, India posted a challenging total of 177, thanks to a brilliant innings by King Kohli, who anchored the innings with his composed yet aggressive batting. The bowlers then took center stage, with Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya delivering crucial breakthroughs. Soon, the final over came where South Africa needed 16 to clinch their first ever ICC trophy and Killer Miller was on strike, the ball was given to Hardik Pandya who rose up to the occasion once again and courtesy a brilliant catch by SKY, removed Miller of the very first ball of the final over. In a thrilling finish, India held their nerve and clinched victory, sparking celebrations across the nation.

        This triumph is a testament to the evolution of Indian cricket over the past decade and a half. It reflects the hard work and dedication of the players, the strategic acumen of the coaching staff, and the unwavering support of the fans. It also highlights the depth of talent in Indian cricket, with young players stepping up and making significant contributions on the global stage.

        For fans like me, this victory is more than just a trophy; it's a moment of immense pride and joy. It brings back memories of 2007 and adds a new chapter to our cricketing folklore. The sight of the players lifting the trophy, the sound of the crowd chanting, and the emotions running high are moments that we will cherish forever.

        As we bask in the glory of this incredible achievement, let's celebrate the spirit of cricket and the unity it brings to our diverse nation. Here's to the heroes who made it possible and to the countless fans who never stopped believing. Jai Hind! üáÆüá≥üèÜüéâ`,
